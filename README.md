# Opinion Dynamics Simulation

This project simulates opinion dynamics on synthetic/empirical networks. It uses Python with libraries such as `networkx`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib` for the simulation and visualization of the results. Additionally, we use Jupyter Lab for an interactive development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.11
- Poetry for dependency management and packaging

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

```
<!-- 1. clone this code into your local -->
git clone git@github.com:Keygoksmg/neat_opinion_network.git

<!-- 2. Install Dependencies:  -->
poetry install


<!-- 3. Create a Jupyter Kernel: -->
poetry run python -m ipykernel install --user --name=my_deGroot_project


4. Launch Jupyter Lab:
poetry run jupyter lab

```
