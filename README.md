# DeGroot Opinion Dynamics Simulation

This project simulates opinion dynamics using the DeGroot model on a synthetic network. It uses Python with libraries such as `networkx`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for the simulation and visualization of the results. Additionally, we use Jupyter Lab for an interactive development environment.
